## Rendering a collection, modules
- console.log (What's the difference between an experienced JavaScript programmer and a rookie? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more)
- React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.
- Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys notes.map((note, i) => ...)

### Getting data from server
- Let's use a tool meant to be used during software development called JSON Server to act as our server.
- JavaScript engines are single-threaded, which means that they cannot execute code in parallel
- The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.


## Altering data in server
- In REST terminology, we refer to individual data objects, such as the notes in our application, as resources.
