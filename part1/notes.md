## Introduction to react
- React components don't return html markup but JSX.
- It is also possible to write React as "pure JavaScript" without using JSX. Although, nobody with a sound mind would actually do so.
- JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed.
- React component names must be capitalized

## Javascript
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and works practically anywhere - from servers to mobile phones. 
-  const does not actually define a variable but a constant for which the value can no longer be changed. On the other hand let defines a normal variable.
- In the previous example, a new item was added to the array using the method push. When using React, techniques from functional programming are often used. One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of immutable data structures. In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat, which does not add the item to the array, but creates a new array in which the content of the old array and the new item are both included.
