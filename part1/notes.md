## Introduction to react
- React components don't return html markup but JSX.
- It is also possible to write React as "pure JavaScript" without using JSX. Although, nobody with a sound mind would actually do so.
- JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed.
- React component names must be capitalized
