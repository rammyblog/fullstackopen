## HTTP GET
- The server and the web browser communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol

- Event handler functions are called callback functions

## AJAX

- The Notes page of the application follows an early-nineties style of web development and "uses Ajax". As such, it's on the crest of the wave of early 2000's web technology.

- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a term introduced in February 2005 on the back of advancements in browser technology to describe a new revolutionary approach that enabled the fetching of content to web pages using JavaScript included within the HTML, without the need to rerender the page.

- Prior to the AJAX era, all web pages worked like the traditional web application we saw earlier in this chapter. All of the data shown on the page was fetched with the HTML-code generated by the server. 

## JavaScript fatigue
- The world of JavaScript develops fast, which brings its own set of challenges. Tools, libraries and the language itself are under constant development. Some are starting to get tired of the constant change, and have coined a term for it: JavaScript fatigue.
